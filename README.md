# RSpec++

You've been using RSpec for a while, you know how to write tests, but you're
not sure you're getting the most from it. Let's spend some time working with
the more advanced features, take a look at the new stuff from RSpec 3 and
talk about making tests faster.

## Ruby

Ideally 2.4.2 but any recent version of ruby will work. (> 2.0)

## Gems

We're going to be running cutting edge RSpec on the day, it's pretty easy, just
clone this repo and run `bundle exec rake setup`, or your `bundle install`
command of choice.

## Commands

To run RSpec style tests: `bundle exec rake spec`

If you'd prefer to run the rspec exectuable directly, you'll need to add `./bin/`
to your path, e.g: `export $PATH=./bin:$PATH`
